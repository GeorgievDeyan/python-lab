# python-lab

Welcome to my Python Lab! 

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, scripts, and coding experiments I create while learning and practicing Python. 

These projects range from utility scripts and automation tools to experiments with APIs and data processing. 

Feel free to explore, learn, and suggest improvements!

## Current projects

- **youtube_downloader** â€“ A script to download YouTube videos and convert them to `.ts` format with MP3 audio.
